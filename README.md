# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science
Applications of algorithoms in Bishop's PRML book.
In computer vision, object recognition is a standard machine learning problem with high impact.  
Throughout the Repository, several essential algorithms are implemented with Handwriting Code in Matlab. Algorithms are applied to several datasets. The level of complexity of the algorithms are compared, and issues of the algorithms are discussed. The databases are mentioned in [The Data](https://github.com/yizhanyang/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/master/README.md#the-data).
