# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science
Applications of algorithms in Bishop's PRML book.
In computer vision, object recognition is a standard machine learning problem with high impact.  
Throughout the Repository, several essential algorithms are implemented with Handwriting Code in Matlab. Algorithms are applied to several datasets. The level of complexity of the algorithms are compared, and issues of the algorithms are discussed. The databases are mentioned in [The Data](https://github.com/yizhanyang/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/master/README.md#the-data). The Project report can be found [here](https://github.com/yizhanyang/Machine-Learning-and-Data-Science/blob/master/MLDS_REPORT.pdf).

## The Algorithms
* Regularized Linear Regression
* Gaussian Kernel Regression
* Gaussian Process
* Support Vector Machine
* Extrme Learning Machine
* Sparse Representation
* Image De-noising Using Markov Random Field
* Image De-noising Using the SP/MS Algorithm
* EM Mixture Model  
  
Each algorithm is evaluated using multi-fold crossvalidaton in the final report, and optimal regularization constants were found.
